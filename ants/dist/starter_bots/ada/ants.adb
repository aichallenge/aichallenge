--
--      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
--      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
--      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
--      and conversions to other media types.
--
--      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
--      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
--      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
--      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
--
--      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
--      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
--      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
--      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
--      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

--      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
--
--      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
--      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
--      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

--
--      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
--      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

--
--   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
--      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
--      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
--      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
--      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
--      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
--
--   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
--      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

--      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
--      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
--      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
--      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
--      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
--      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
--      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
--      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
--      as of the date such litigation is filed.
--
--   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
--      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
--      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
--      meet the following conditions:
--
--      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
--          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
--
--      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
--          stating that You changed the files; and
--
--      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
--          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
--          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
--          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
--          the Derivative Works; and
--
--      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
--          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
--          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
--          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
--          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
--          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
--          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
--          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
--          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
--          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
--          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
--          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
--          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
--          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
--          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
--          as modifying the License.
--
--      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
--      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
--      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
--      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
--      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
--      the conditions stated in this License.
--
--   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
--      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
--      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
--      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
--      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
--      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
--      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
--
--   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
--      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
--      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
--      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
--
--   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
--      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
--      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
--      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
--      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
--      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
--      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
--      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
--      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
--
--   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
--      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
--      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
--      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
--      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
--      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
--      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
--      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
--      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
--      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
--      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
--
--   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
--      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
--      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
--      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
--      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
--      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
--      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
--      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
--      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
--      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
--
