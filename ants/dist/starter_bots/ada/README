This is an Ada Starter Bot for http://aichallenge.org/

The compilation has been tested with GCC 4.5.2 on Slackware 13.37 using the instructions in the included Makefile


Known issues:

- Ants currently all change direction when one changes direction since I'm not sure yet how to

- I don't understand the concept of "visibility" yet so that may not be implemented properly. If anyone can enlighten me on this I can take a look at it.
