## A Dart Language package for the Google AI Challenge Fall 2011 Ants Contest

# Supported Systems

This package works on OSX and Linux. It has not been tested on Windows.

# Installation

Step 1: Install the Node.js runtime:

Download and unzip Node.js 0.4.10.zip: https://github.com/joyent/node/zipball/v0.4.10
Follow the build and install instructions in README.md
Double-check that you have the correct version of Node installed:

    $ node --version
    v0.4.10

(This is because the Ants contest uses this version of Node.)

Step 2: Install the Dart frogsh compiler:

    $ curl -O http://ants-dart-starter-package.googlecode.com/files/dart-frogsh-r1499.tgz
    $ tar xvzf dart-frogsh-r1499.tgz

    Then follow instructions in dart-frogsh-r1499/README

# Running your bot

The frogsh command will compile and run your bot:

    $ frogsh MyBot.dart

# Credits

This package is based upon the JavaScript starter pack. It has been converted to the Dart language.
